# Enigma

I believe I met expectations or better in all areas.

### Functionality: Above Expectations 
- Above Expectations
- Encrypt/Decrypt fully working
- Cracking: On 'crack' branch. It DOES work and has the command line interface implemented, but I found some edgecase bugs and the code is messier. So I kept it seperate.

### Object Oriented Programming
- Meets expectations 
- I chose to work on the cracking feature and did not have time to do a module 

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
- Meets expectations, might exceed
- I believe I met the requirements for exceeding, but harder to me to access standard ruby practice 

### Test Driven Development
- Exceeds expectations
